# Data Loading

1. *Data-Loading.ipynb* - Jupyter notebook which contains code to load audio with the desired parameters (choice of instrument, octave etc.) and split it into train and test audio.   
This notebook has been made keeping in mind the database structure of good-sounds. However, the structure can be modified to be used with other datasets (like NSynth)
